            <h2>Site Name</h2>
            <h3>Local Business Showcase</h3>
            <p><strong>Proposed Domain:</strong> local-biz-showcase.com</p>
            <p>I chose this name because it clearly communicates the website's purpose - showcasing local businesses in the community. The name is descriptive, easy to remember, and professional. It immediately tells visitors what they can expect to find on the site. The word "showcase" implies a curated, quality presentation of businesses, which aligns with the goal of highlighting local establishments in an attractive and organized way.</p>
